## [Space Invaders Game](https://github.com/leon-98/Functional_programming_Space_Invaders)

- Developed a version of the  Space Invaders game using Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) techniques.
- The game was implemented in TypeScript and uses  RxJS Observable streams to handle animation and user interaction.
- The code also separates impure function from pure functions.
- For the game, you can hover your mouse on the canvas to move, left click to use ability and pressing return will reset the game when it ends.
- Skills: FRP techniques, TypeScript, RxJS
- Below is the image of the game, you can click on it to give it a try.

## [Text-Based Roguelike game](https://github.com/leon-98/Dinosaur_Game)

- Wrote a text-based roguelike game in Java and implemented it with object oriented design.
- The game is about dinosaurs and the player can interact with them. 
- This game was a group assignment of mine for a unit I took called "Object Oriented design and Implementation" (FIT2099).
- Applied object oriented programming which allows reusability of code and  for easy maintenance of code
- Skills: Java, Object Oriented Design
